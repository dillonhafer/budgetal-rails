--------

Budgetal is about helping you save money, planning for expenses, chasing away emergencies, and beginning to build wealth.

Setup
-----

### Quick Setup

First make sure the [dependencies](#dependencies) are met. Then:

**rake**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dillonhafer/budgetal
$ cd budgetal && rake setup
```

**manually**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dillonhafer/budgetal
$ cd budgetal && bundle
$ cp .env{.example,}
$ rake db:setup
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ rails s
$ open http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment Variables

Budgetal is designed to be a [12-Factor](http://12factor.net/) application. As such it uses environment variables for each type of deployment. Budgetal uses the [dotenv-rails gem](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) for each environment. When setting up a new development deploy on your local machine, be sure to `cp .env{.example,}` so you can setup your local configuration.

### Frontend

Budgetal uses webpack to build most of the front end resources, mainly React.

**Development**

Run webpack in watch mode using script:

```
$ npm start
```

**Production**

Run webpack in production mode before compiling assets using script (this is done in the mina script):

```
$ npm run build
```

Run webpack/rails in hot-auto-reloading mode using script (to use it you have to set the `hot` ENV var):

```
$ hot=1 rails s
$ npm run start-hot-dev
```

### Dependencies

**PostgreSQL**

Your postgres installation must be at a version >= 9.4. This is due to the `pgcrypto` extension needed to run migrations.
Migrations can/should be run with a *superuser* in production environments by adding `RAILS_DATABASE_USER=my_super_pg_user`
to the `overrides.env` file that was created during `mina setup`.

**node/npm/webpack**

Budgetal's frontend is built with webpack and needs npm/node

```bash
$ brew install node
$ npm install webpack -g
```

**Chrome Driver**

Budgetal tests depend on the selenium chrome driver

```bash
$ brew install chromedriver
```

See the [Chrome Driver website](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) for more details.

### Testing

1. Setup database `RAILS_ENV=test rake db:schema:load`
2. Run `rake` to run both JS and rspec suites.

**Individual test suites**

1. Run rpsec tests `rspec spec`
2. Run JS tests `npm test`

For continuous integration mode with JS tests run

```
npm test -- --no-single-run
```

### Deployment

If you plan on using the included deploy tasks please make sure you have `mina` and `mina-hooks` gems installed on your system.

A full deploy would look like this:

```
$ gem install mina
$ gem install mina-hooks
$ mina setup
$ mina deploy
```

TODO:
 - [ ] Add deployment config env variables
